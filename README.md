# Sonar Rock vs. Mine Prediction

## Overview
This project is a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either **rock** or **mine**. The dataset contains sonar signal readings that help distinguish between these two categories. The model is built using Python and includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and model training.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of sonar signal readings, where:
- Each row represents an instance of sonar reflections.
- The target variable indicates whether the signal corresponds to a rock or a mine.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sonar-rock-mine-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd sonar-rock-mine-prediction
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sonar-rock-vs-mine-prediction.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells to perform data analysis and model training.

## Model Training
The notebook includes the following steps:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Understanding patterns and distributions.
- **Model Selection:** Training and evaluating different models.
- **Prediction:** Using the trained model to classify new sonar signals.

## Results
The model is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The final trained model can be used for real-time sonar classification.
